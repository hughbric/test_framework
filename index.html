  <h1>The Challenge</h1>
  <p>
    The aim of this exercise is to further explore JavaScript by implementing something found in every unit testing tool - an "assertEquals" method.</p>
  <h1>Expected Result</h1>
  The following tests should "fail":  <strong>02, 03, 04, 07, 08 and 09</strong><br/>
  The following output is what to be expected for the initial couple of tests:
  <ul class="expected">
    <li>Test 02: Expected "abcdef" found "abc"</li>
    <li>Test 03: Expected type Array but found Object</li>
    <li>Test 04: Expected array length 2 but found 3</li>
    <li>Test 07: Expected propB.propA[1].propB "b" but found "c"</li>
    <li>Test 08: Expected propB.propC but was not found</li>
    <li>Test 09: Expected type null but found type Object</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1>Output</h1>
  <ul class="output" id="messages"></ul>
